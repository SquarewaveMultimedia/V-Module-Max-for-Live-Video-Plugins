Ver 0.7.2
- All V-FX-GL effects rewritten with more efficient chaining (GPU only). Note: Requires a V-Mixer to be in the liveset in order to work. This is true also for VIZZable users.
- Tools for morphing of OpenGL objects (vertex morphing): 
- Tools for movement 3D recording and editing (as matrixset/JXF format): V-GMoveCapture3D, V-GMoveState3D, V-GMovePort3D, V-GMoveEdit3D, V-GMovePlay3D

- New device type: V-OpenGL-Processor for post-processing-like effects on top of 3D objects (based on OpenGL shaders)
- V-GL-RenderMixer4RGBPostFdbk, a new version of the V-Mixer allowing full scene post-processing by V-OpenGL-Processor devices

- V-ZoomPlay modified to easier "still picture scanning"
- Framework to support Vade's v001 shaders  (http://001.vade.info) as a V-FX-GL effect (V-FX-GL-V001lab)

- OpenGL-FX on vertex manipulation with simple physics of an oscillator applied on 3D object coordinates (V-FX-GLOscillator)

Ver 0.7
- New V-AuInstruments for playback of clips having both video and audio. Audio and video playback is in sync, audio sent through Live's mixer: V-SimAudioPlay, V-SliceAudioBeat, V-VideoAudioRack
- New V-SimAudioLooper an V-SimLooper for Live tempo warp-looping of video clips (respectively with and without audio feed)
- New V-FX-FFWrapper for FreeFrame plugins support
- All previously available V-Instruments (MIDI devices) for QT playback do not spill audio "outside" of Live
- New V-AuBeat based on external op.beatitude~ for Live tempo settings from audio input (even a live feed from external)
- New V-AuBeat2CVEnvelope based on external op.beatitude~ for very tight CV envelope generation from audio input (even a live feed from external)
- All video input devices save file (clips/folder) as part of the liveset
- V-ObjShape expanded for advanced texturing, multi rendering (cloning). It also saves the file as part of the liveset
- New V-ZoomPlay added (for picture zooming)
- Various enhancements to V-GMove3DW devices (3D camera movements) including a toggle for 2d/3d view switch

Ver 0.6 
- V-SlabGen instrument introduced for generation of visuals (such as procedural fractals) based on custom OpenGL shaders. 
- V-GTexture introduced for texture operations, such as video-to-texture (texture mapping in a 3D object) and texture-to-video (rendering to texture, feedback) 
- V-GMulti introduced for efficient cloning of a source 3D object, creating potentially a very large number of 3D clones in space 
- Added a V-Mixer version with OpenGL based internal 3D video feedback. 
- Added a large number of OpenGL effects and devices for density, proximity, morphing applications 
- Added a number of V-AuScope (audio) processing effects for tighter audio to video manipulation. 
- Added a range of OpenGL coordinate formula generators (such as V-GCoord3 and V-GCoord4) for more control/customization of 3D objects. 
- Added V-Boids instrument with simple fluid simulator. 
- Added V-AuEnvelope audio effect for tracking beats and generating envelopes based on Live’s tempo 

Ver 0.5
- Solved some bugs with open GL effects and mixer apparently due to video window automatically pop-up. Note: on V-Mixer devices you need to explicitly set "screen ON" now to have a window.
- Added a V-Mixer version (V-GL-RenderMixer4RGB-Out.amxd) for an additional output stream (useful for instance to do recording to disk by V-Rec)
- Several "video" / non 3D devices (V-VideoRack, V-SliceBeat, V-GL-Rota, V-GL-Slab) support ChrisG auto connect mode (i.e. in combination with VIZZable 0.9.2 or later. See device names with "-auto" suffix.
- LiveAPI LFO modulation supported (and LFO parameter bank removed). Each device shows its parameters (shortnames) for modulation and the V-LiveMod new device allows CVsend to LiveAPI modulation mapping
- V-Effects type OpenGL revised: no additional window required and better backread / readback support.
- V-Control device V-DroidSens2CV and V-DroidCtrl2CV added for Android control in combination with Matt Benatan's Max/MSP control app available at http://mattbenatan.com/)  
- V-Control device V-Joy2CV added for support of HID usb devices (such as Joystick, Gamepad) etc. as CVsend (using the V-CV2MIDI you can use these to send MIDI informations).
- Several new OpenGL 3D tools (V-GCoord3, V-FX-GLOpScalar, V-GMove3DWJoy, V-GMove3DWPad) 

Ver 0.4
- Major review of all devices for compatibility against Ableton Max for Live Production Guidelines v0.6:
 - All GUI parameters are labeled in a meaningful way (see info view). Yes, you read it right: ALL GUI parameters.
 - The most significant GUI parameters (all type float and/or int, according to M4L constraints) can be mapped and automated for clip envelopes. 
 - Many devices have useful info view text (thanks M._TriangelKlang for the help)
 - All devices behave politely and do not spill into Undo history (no loadbang on live.objects, Max umenu managed through pattr instances) 
 - All devices are frozen and directly compatibile with OSX and Windows OS
- Enhancements and fixes on many devices, in particular for V-Input devices:
 - All V-Input devices have rate which can also go into negative values (thanks ChrisG for the tip)
 - All V-Input devices are now efficient with memory and use both drag'n'drop and click-to-read ways to open clips (thanks to ChrisG for the "invisible button").
 - V-VideoRack supports Thumbnails creation also iffolder is selected while device is ON.
 - V-VideoRack, V-SliceBeat, V-Mixer and most V-Effects have full Info View help 
- Some OpenGL devices will see improvement in the use of backread technique
- Documentation PDF updated and corrected to reflect changes
